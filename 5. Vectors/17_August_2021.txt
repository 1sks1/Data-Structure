Hi,
I watched shershaah last night, so i went to bed at 4 AM but could not sleep untill 5:30 AM. So i woke up late( but usual time for me) at 10 AM.
Did some of my responsibilites and had breakfast till 12:30 PM.
Time to do some real work for my academics- shortly- " Study Time".

What i want to achieve in next 1-2 months:-
I have lot of things in my mind which are really important. Like, doing Algo and Data structure course of GFG in c++, doing kunal kushwaha's data structure and algo course in JAVA.
I know doing Algo and DS in one language is enough to and jobs but i have lots of time on my hand and it will be useful get grasp of Java as it is really popular for Jobs. But will do it slowly as i get to practice c++ while learning java.

I have to continue Flutter as i have invested time and energy in understanding concepts and i can't let it go to waste, plus it will give me chance to do freelancing and land small internships.
Waiting of result of financial aid application result for Machine Learning and matlab Advance course.

I am really excited to follow gfg course to get good understanding of concepts of DS and then solve problems and upload them to my github repository.

Todays Goals:-
a.) Start lesson 3. Bit Manipulation of GFG course and Complete it.
b.) solve 10 leetcode problems on time complexity and mathematics each and push them to github repository along with question.
c.) Revise flutter map project and complete it.
d.) Roam round github and learn more about it.
e.) Search for goot courses related to flutter on coursera and apply for it.
f.) Typing Master practice.

Hope i could achieve todays goal. I have more than 10 hours to do these, which is more than enough. Current time- 12:30 PM.
